Pewlett Hackard is making preparations for the baby boomers that will be retiring in the near future. The first preparation PH is making is to provide a retirement package for those who meet a certain criteria. Secondly, it is anticpating which positions will need to be filled. The analysis performed provides the answers to the two most important questions of who and how many will be retiring through providing the information of all employees eligible for retirement package. 

## Results
In the deliverable 1 analysis, I have created a retirement title table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. The following image below shows the excerpt of 10 employees from a table that contains the emp_no, first_name, last_name and title.
